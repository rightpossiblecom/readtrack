# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 22, 2026

## Overview

ReadTrack ("the App") is a simple reading time tracker developed to help users build a consistent daily reading habit. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles information.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information.**

The App does not require you to create an account. It does not ask for your name, email address, phone number, or any other identifying information.

## Data Storage

All data you enter into ReadTrack — including your reading logs, streak history, and settings — is stored **locally on your device only**. This data is never transmitted to any external server, cloud service, or third party.

## Analytics and Tracking

ReadTrack contains **no analytics tracking**, no advertising SDKs, and no third-party data collection tools. We do not track how you use the App.

## Internet Access

ReadTrack requests no internet permissions for core functionality. The only outbound links in the App open your device browser to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service — no data is sent.

## Children's Privacy

ReadTrack is suitable for all ages. Because we collect no data, there are no special requirements for use by children.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this Privacy Policy, we will update the effective date above. Continued use of the App following any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

ReadTrack is built with Flutter. All data is stored locally using Hive, an on-device key-value store. No data leaves your device.
