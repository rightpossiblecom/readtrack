# 📘 ReadTrack – Simple App Plan

## 1️⃣ App Goal

ReadTrack helps users build a daily reading habit by tracking how many minutes they read each day and showing their consistency through a streak counter.

The focus is:

* Daily reading minutes
* Consistency
* Simple visual progress

No coaching.
No speed tracking.
No book database.
No complex analytics.

---

## 2️⃣ What The App Does

* User logs how many minutes they read today
* App stores daily reading time
* Shows current streak
* Shows weekly summary
* Stores everything locally

---

## 3️⃣ What The App Does NOT Do

* No book recommendations
* No summaries
* No AI
* No speed tracking
* No PDF reader
* No sync accounts
* No claims like “improves intelligence” or “boosts brain power”

Position it as:

> “A simple reading time tracker.”

---

# 4️⃣ Core User Story

> As a user, I open ReadTrack, enter how many minutes I read today, see my streak increase, and close the app feeling consistent.

---

# 5️⃣ App Pages Structure

## 🏠 1. Home Screen (Main Screen)

This is the heart of the app.

Top:

* Today’s date
* Current streak 🔥

Center:

* Big number display:

  * “Today: 0 min” (or entered value)
* Input field:

  * “Enter minutes read”
* Button: “Log Reading”

Below:

* Small weekly progress preview (7 small bars or numbers)

If already logged today:

* Show “You’ve logged 25 minutes today.”
* Allow edit

---

## 📅 2. Weekly Summary Page

Simple overview:

* 7-day list:

  * Mon – 20 min
  * Tue – 15 min
  * Wed – 0 min
* Total minutes this week
* Longest streak

No charts needed, but a simple bar visualization is fine.

Keep it clean.

---

## ⚙️ 3. Settings Page

* Daily reading goal (optional, like 20 min default)
* Reset data
* Dark mode toggle
* Privacy Policy
* App version

Keep it minimal.

---

# 6️⃣ The “Nice-to-Have” Feature (Only One)

### 🎯 Daily Goal Indicator

User sets a daily goal (example: 20 minutes).

On Home screen:

* Progress circle or bar fills as they log minutes
* If they reach goal → subtle celebration (small animation or color change)

This adds motivation without complexity.

Important:
Do NOT say:

* “Scientifically proven reading improvement”
* “Improve memory”
* “Boost intelligence”

Just:

> “Set a daily reading goal.”

That keeps Play Store safe.

---

# 7️⃣ Streak Logic

* If user logs > 0 minutes → streak continues
* If user logs 0 or skips day → streak resets
* Streak increments once per day only

Simple rule = fewer bugs.

---

# 8️⃣ MVP Scope (Realistic 3–4 Hours)

### Must Have

* Log minutes
* Store daily entry
* Streak counter
* Weekly summary list
* Local storage only

### Nice to Have (Chosen Feature)

* Daily goal + progress indicator

---

# 9️⃣ Why This App Is Strong

* Clear single purpose
* Habit-forming through streak
* Not overloaded
* Feels intentional
* Broad audience (students, professionals, casual readers)

It’s simple but not empty.

---

# 10️⃣ Play Store Positioning

Use phrases like:

* “Track your daily reading time”
* “Build a consistent reading habit”
* “Simple reading log app”
* “Minimal reading tracker”

Avoid:

* Brain improvement claims
* Academic performance claims
* Medical claims
* Productivity promises

Keep it neutral and clean.

If you want next, I can:

* Write the Play Store description
* Draft a simple privacy policy text
* Or define the exact UI layout spacing and component structure for fastest development

Your move.
